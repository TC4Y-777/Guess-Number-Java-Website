When using ajax (throught vanilla js), we must keep somethings in mind.
The arguments we pass in the send() method will be treated as the data
that is to be sent in the request body.
If we are using the GET method, then when the request is made, the request
body will be made empty and then only will the request be sent. If we 
specify any data on the send() method, it will be ignored. We know that 
in GET method, data is passed as parameters in the url itself. So, it must
be specified along with the url in the open() method itself.
